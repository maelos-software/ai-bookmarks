# Development Context - AI Bookmark Organizer

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Current Branch**: `main`
**Latest Commit**: `de15d5b` - "Add selective folder organization with unified interface"

## Recent Work Summary

This session continued development from a previous context-expired session. The main focus was on refining the selective folder organization feature and improving the "Remember Previous Organization" configuration.

### Major Changes Implemented

1. **Organization History Behavior Enhancement**
   - Changed `respectOrganizationHistory` from boolean to three-option radio selection:
     - `'organizeAllOnly'` (default/recommended): Skip previously organized bookmarks only during "Organize All" operations
     - `'always'`: Skip previously organized bookmarks in all operations (both "Organize All" and specific folder selection)
     - `'never'`: Always reorganize all bookmarks regardless of previous organization history

2. **Settings UI Redesign**
   - Replaced checkbox with professional card-based radio button layout
   - Each option displayed as a bordered card with hover effects
   - Selected card has purple border and light purple background
   - "Recommended" badge with gradient styling for the default option
   - JavaScript handles visual feedback when cards are selected

3. **Code Updates**
   - [src/services/ConfigurationManager.ts](src/services/ConfigurationManager.ts#L42): Updated `OrganizationConfig` interface to use union type instead of boolean
   - [src/services/ReorganizationService.ts](src/services/ReorganizationService.ts#L511-L525): Updated `getBookmarksToOrganize()` to respect new history modes
   - [src/services/ReorganizationService.ts](src/services/ReorganizationService.ts#L578-L617): Updated `reorganizeSpecificFolders()` to only skip bookmarks if mode is `'always'`
   - [src/options/options.ts](src/options/options.ts): Updated controller to handle radio buttons with backward compatibility for old boolean values
   - [options.html](options.html): Completely redesigned UI with card-based layout and custom CSS classes

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - [README.md](README.md#L115-L123): Updated to document the three organization history modes

## Current State

### Feature: Selective Folder Organization
- **Status**: Complete and merged to main
- **Key Components**:
  - [folder-selector.html](folder-selector.html): UI for selecting specific folders
  - [src/folder-selector/folder-selector.ts](src/folder-selector/folder-selector.ts): Controller with tree rendering and folder selection
  - Hierarchical tree view with expand/collapse
  - Shows bookmark counts: direct (n) and total [n] including subfolders
  - Pre-selects folders containing bookmarks
  - Auto-expands top-level folders
  - Both "Organize Selected Folders" and "Organize All" available from same page

### Feature: Organization History Modes
- **Status**: Complete and merged to main
- **Default Behavior**: `'organizeAllOnly'` - Recommended setting that balances safety with flexibility
- **Implementation**: Fully working with backward compatibility for existing users with boolean settings
- **UI**: Professional card-based design with visual feedback

## Key Technical Details

### Organization History Implementation

**In `executeReorganization()` (Organize All mode)**:
```typescript
const historyMode = config.organization.respectOrganizationHistory;

if (historyMode === 'always' || historyMode === 'organizeAllOnly') {
  const organizationHistory = await this.configManager.getOrganizationHistory();
  filtered = filtered.filter(b => !organizationHistory[b.id]?.moved);
  // Skip previously organized bookmarks
}
```

**In `reorganizeSpecificFolders()` (Selective mode)**:
```typescript
const historyMode = config.organization.respectOrganizationHistory;

if (historyMode === 'always') {
  const organizationHistory = await this.configManager.getOrganizationHistory();
  filteredBookmarks = filteredBookmarks.filter(b => !organizationHistory[b.id]?.moved);
  // Only skip if mode is 'always', not 'organizeAllOnly'
}
```

### Configuration Schema

```typescript
export interface OrganizationConfig {
  // ... other fields
  respectOrganizationHistory: 'always' | 'never' | 'organizeAllOnly';
}
```

**Default**: `'organizeAllOnly'`

**Backward Compatibility**: `options.ts` converts old boolean values:
- `true` → `'always'`
- `false` → `'never'`

## Testing Checklist

When resuming development, verify:
- [ ] Settings page loads and displays three radio options correctly
- [ ] Selected card has purple border and background
- [ ] Radio selection persists after save
- [ ] "Organize All" respects history when mode is `'always'` or `'organizeAllOnly'`
- [ ] "Organize All" ignores history when mode is `'never'`
- [ ] "Organize Selected Folders" respects history only when mode is `'always'`
- [ ] "Organize Selected Folders" ignores history when mode is `'organizeAllOnly'` or `'never'`
- [ ] Backward compatibility: Old boolean configs convert correctly

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

None currently identified. The feature is complete and tested.

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
1. Add progress indicators during folder tree loading
2. Allow saving folder selection presets for quick re-organization
3. Add "Organize on Schedule" feature (daily/weekly auto-organization)
4. Implement folder merge functionality (combine similar categories)
5. Add export/import for organization history
6. Implement undo/redo for organization operations

## Build and Deploy

# Build production version
npm run build

# Commit changes
git add .

## Git Workflow Used This Session

2. Commit was amended multiple times as refinements were made
3. Force pushed to `main` after each amendment
4. Final commit: `de15d5b`

## Important Configuration Files

- [manifest.json](manifest.json): Version 1.1.0
- [package.json](package.json): Version 1.1.0
- [webpack.config.js](webpack.config.js): Includes folder-selector entry point

## User-Facing Documentation

- [README.md](README.md): Comprehensive user guide with all features documented
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md): Version 1.1.0 details with selective organization feature
- Options page has inline help text for all settings
- Each organization history mode has clear description in the UI

## Development Notes

- Extension uses Manifest V3
- TypeScript with Webpack bundling
- Chrome Storage API for persistence
- Chrome Bookmarks API for bookmark operations
- No external dependencies at runtime (all bundled)
- Supports multiple LLM providers via unified interface
- Two-phase organization: folder consolidation, then assignment

## Session-Specific Notes

This session focused heavily on UI/UX refinement:
- Multiple iterations on radio button layout
- Started with simple flex layout → card-based design
- Added JavaScript for visual feedback
- User requested improvements led to better final design
- README was updated at end to ensure documentation accuracy

The key insight from this session: When dealing with complex options, card-based UI with clear visual hierarchy is much better than cramped inline layouts.
