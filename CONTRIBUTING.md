### Development Commands

```bash
npm run build          # Production build
npm run build:dev      # Development build
npm run dev            # Watch mode (rebuilds on changes)
npm run type-check     # TypeScript type checking
npm run clean          # Remove build artifacts
```

## Making Changes

### Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   - Load the extension in Chrome
   - Test all affected functionality
   - Verify no console errors
   - Check different AI providers if applicable

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests where relevant

Examples:
```

2. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List any breaking changes

3. **Respond to feedback**:
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Update your PR as needed
   - Keep the conversation focused and professional

### PR Checklist

Before submitting, ensure:
- [ ] Code builds without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Extension loads and functions in Chrome
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated for user-facing changes

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Use TypeScript**: All code should be written in TypeScript
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any` types; use proper type definitions
- **Interfaces**: Define interfaces for data structures
- **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over promises chains

Example:
```typescript
// Good
interface BookmarkData {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  url: string;
}

async function getBookmarks(): Promise<BookmarkData[]> {
  const result = await chrome.bookmarks.getTree();
  return processBookmarks(result);
}

// Avoid
function getBookmarks(): any {
  return chrome.bookmarks.getTree().then(result => {
    return processBookmarks(result);
  });
}
```

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Line Length**: 100 characters max
- **Semicolons**: Required
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings
- **Naming**:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

### Project Structure

Place files according to their purpose:
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ background/     # Service worker code
â”œâ”€â”€ popup/          # Popup UI logic
â”œâ”€â”€ options/        # Settings page logic
â”œâ”€â”€ results/        # Results page logic
â””â”€â”€ services/       # Shared business logic
    â”œâ”€â”€ BookmarkManager.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ LLMService.ts
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Error Handling

Always handle errors appropriately:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await someAsyncOperation();
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('ComponentName', 'Operation failed', error);
  // Handle error gracefully
}
```

## Testing

Currently, testing is manual. When testing:

1. **Test Core Functionality**:
   - Bookmark organization with different providers
   - Settings persistence
   - Error handling

2. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Large bookmark collections (1000+)
   - Empty bookmark folders
   - Special characters in bookmark names
   - Network errors and timeouts

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test in Chrome
   - Verify Manifest V3 compliance
